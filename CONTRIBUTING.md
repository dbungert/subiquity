Thank you for considering a contribution to Subiquity.  Here's what we like to
see:

* Contributors will need to have signed the
  [CLA](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors/agreement).
* Format, lint, unit, integration, and API tests should be passing.
  * format - either run `make format` or `pre-commit install`.
    See [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) for more details on that
    tool.
  * lint/unit/integration - `make lint check`
    Prerequisites for running these locally can be installed with
    `make aptdeps`.
